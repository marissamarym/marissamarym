### Hi! Welcome to my GitHub page.

I'm [Marissa](https://m15y.com), the founder of Instantish.

Instantish is a totally different kind of issue tracker. It's built to be used by engineers _and_ non-engineers, and lives in Slack (where, let's be honest, your team lives too). It also integrates very closely with GitHub.

Sign up for the early access [here](https://itsinstantish.com).

See my pinned repos for GitHub Actions and resources from Instantish.
